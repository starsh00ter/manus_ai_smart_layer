## RAG Test Log (2025-09-10)

**Test Query:** "Based on our system's knowledge graph and archived research, what are the key bottlenecks identified in Manus AI's memory system, and what solutions have been proposed for them?"

**RAG Protocol Execution:**

1.  **Query Classification:** Classified as "Complex Synthesis" (requires information from KG and archived documents).

2.  **Strategy Selection:** Selected a hybrid strategy:
    *   **Direct KG Query:** To identify `BOTTLENECK` entities and their `ADDRESSED_BY` `SOLUTION` entities from `/home/ubuntu/my_manus_knowledge/knowledge_graph/data.md`.
    *   **Vector Search + Re-ranking:** To retrieve detailed descriptions of these bottlenecks and solutions from relevant archived documents (e.g., `memory_enhancement_proposal.md`, `self_reflection_*.md`).

3.  **Information Retrieval:**
    *   **KG Retrieval:** Queried `knowledge_graph/data.md` and identified:
        *   Bottleneck: "Lack of a Meta-Index" -> Solution: "Meta-Index via Simplified Knowledge Graph"
        *   Bottleneck: "Static RAG Protocol" -> Solution: "Dynamic and Adaptive RAG Protocol"
    *   **Archived Document Retrieval:** Searched `/home/ubuntu/my_manus_knowledge/archive/` and retrieved `memory_enhancement_proposal.md` for detailed descriptions of these bottlenecks and proposed solutions.

4.  **Synthesis:** Synthesized information from the KG (relationships) and the `memory_enhancement_proposal.md` (detailed descriptions).

**Answer Generated:**

Based on our system's knowledge graph and archived research, two key bottlenecks have been identified in Manus AI's memory system, and specific solutions have been proposed for them:

1.  **Bottleneck: Lack of a Meta-Index**
    *   **Description:** The system previously lacked a comprehensive meta-index that described the relationships between all core system files and their contents, limiting holistic understanding.
    *   **Proposed Solution: Meta-Index via Simplified Knowledge Graph:** This solution involves implementing a lightweight, file-based knowledge graph to serve as a meta-index. This KG represents entities (like files, concepts, roles) and their relationships, enabling more intelligent retrieval and contextual understanding. It is stored in `/home/ubuntu/my_manus_knowledge/knowledge_graph/data.md` with its schema in `schema.md`.

2.  **Bottleneck: Static RAG Protocol**
    *   **Description:** The previous RAG protocol was static and did not adapt to query complexity or learn from past interactions, limiting the
