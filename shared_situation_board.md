# Shared Situation Board

**Last Updated:** 2025-09-28 02:17 UTC  
**Account B Status:** Active - Setting up collaboration infrastructure  
**Account A Status:** Working on database setup  

## Current Priorities

### Account A (Brother Project)
- **Status:** Setting up database infrastructure
- **Current Task:** Database schema and table creation
- **Next:** Coordinate with Account B on shared schemas

### Account B (Smart Layer)
- **Status:** Enhancing collaboration and persistence
- **Current Task:** Creating shared situation board and credit awareness
- **Next:** Enhance existing code with reusable traces

## Credit Flow Awareness

### Current Usage
- **Account A:** Unknown (needs sync)
- **Account B:** Monitoring via enhanced router.py
- **Daily Limit:** 300,000 tokens shared
- **Strategy:** Use DeepSeek API exclusively to preserve Manus credits

### Credit Conservation Measures
- ✅ Enhanced router.py with shared credit management
- ✅ Cache system for API calls (memory/cache/)
- ⏳ Shared credit ledger (pending Account A coordination)

## Shared Resources

### Database
- **Status:** Account A setting up
- **Schema Strategy:** 
  - `shared` schema for common resources
  - `smart_layer` schema for Account B
  - `manus_origin` schema for Account A

### Code Sharing
- **manus_core:** Shared library as submodule
- **Status:** Enhanced with persistence features
- **Location:** `/home/ubuntu/my_manus_knowledge/manus_core`

## Coordination Protocol

### Communication
- **Method:** Shared situation board updates
- **Frequency:** After each major operation
- **Format:** Markdown with timestamps

### Work Distribution
- **Account A:** Database infrastructure, core schemas
- **Account B:** Persistence enhancements, caching, logging
- **Shared:** Credit management, coordination protocols

## Reusable Traces

### Cache System
- **Location:** `memory/cache/`
- **Strategy:** Hash-based caching for API calls
- **Status:** Active and working

### Documentation
- **Location:** Various `.md` files
- **Strategy:** Document all expensive operations
- **Status:** Ongoing

### Todo Management
- **Location:** `todo.md` (local), shared board (this file)
- **Strategy:** Track all pending work
- **Status:** Active

## Next Actions

### Immediate (Account B)
1. ✅ Create shared situation board
2. ⏳ Enhance existing code with persistence
3. ⏳ Verify credit awareness system
4. ⏳ Document collaboration process

### Coordination Needed
1. **Database Schema Sync:** Account A to share schema progress
2. **Credit Ledger Integration:** Both accounts sync usage
3. **Shared Cache Strategy:** Coordinate cache invalidation

## Notes

- Account B has enhanced router.py with shared credit management
- manus_core submodule contains shared database client
- All expensive operations are cached to avoid duplicate work
- Focus on enhancing existing code rather than rebuilding

---

**Update Instructions:**
- Each account updates their status after major operations
- Include timestamp and brief description of changes
- Mark completed items with ✅, pending with ⏳, blocked with ❌
