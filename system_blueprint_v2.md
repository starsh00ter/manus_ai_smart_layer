## System Blueprint v2: Automated Research Ingestion and Contextualization

**Role:** System Architect

**Objective:** To evolve Manus AI from a reactive tool to a proactive intelligence by automating the ingestion of research documents and enhancing their contextualization within the knowledge base.

### 1. Analysis: Identified Key Bottleneck

**Bottleneck:** Manual and reactive information ingestion. Currently, research documents and other external information are primarily introduced into the system via manual file uploads or direct copy-pasting by the user. This process is inefficient, relies heavily on user intervention, and lacks automated contextualization (tagging, cross-linking) upon ingestion.

**Impact:**
*   **Scalability:** Limits the volume and frequency of information that can be processed.
*   **Timeliness:** Delays the integration of new research into the active knowledge base.
*   **Contextual Gaps:** Information is not automatically enriched with tags or linked to existing knowledge, reducing RAG effectiveness and overall system intelligence.

### 2. Synthesis: Proposed Automated Workflow - "Proactive Research Digest"

This workflow will automate the discovery, ingestion, tagging, and contextual linking of new research articles from predefined trusted sources. It will leverage Manus AI's `browser` and `omni_search` capabilities for harvesting, and internal logic for processing.

**Workflow Steps:**

1.  **Source Monitoring & Harvesting (Web Scraping):**
    *   Access a predefined list of trusted research sources (e.g., arXiv, Medium publications, specific blogs).
    *   Identify new articles based on keywords (from `monitored_keywords.md`) or publication dates.
    *   Use `browser_navigate` and `browser_view` to extract article content.
2.  **Automated Ingestion & Initial Processing:**
    *   Save extracted article content to `/home/ubuntu/my_manus_knowledge/inbox/`.
    *   Generate a concise summary of the article.
3.  **Intelligent Auto-Tagging:**
    *   Analyze the article's content (summary and full text) against the `monitored_keywords.md` and `archive/index.md`.
    *   Automatically assign relevant tags (e.g., #PromptEngineering, #RAG, #KnowledgeGraph) based on content analysis and existing taxonomy.
    *   Propose new tags if significant, recurring themes are identified that are not yet in our taxonomy.
4.  **Contextual Cross-Linking (Enhanced RAG):**
    *   Perform an internal RAG query using the new article's summary and tags against the `archive/index.md`.
    *   Identify existing archived documents that are semantically related.
    *   Generate a list of suggested cross-references (e.g., "Related to: [2025-09-10_Lakera_Prompt_Engineering_Summary.md]").
5.  **Archiving & Indexing:**
    *   Move the processed article (with summary, tags, and cross-links) from `/inbox/` to `/archive/`.
    *   Update `archive/index.md` with the new entry, including its summary, tags, and cross-references.
6.  **User Notification & Review:**
    *   Generate a brief digest of newly ingested articles.
    *   Notify the user of the new additions and any proposed new tags or significant cross-links for review.

### 3. Proposal: Implementation Details

**New Workflow Name:** Proactive Research Digest

**Scheduled Task Prompt:**

```
**TASK: Execute Proactive Research Digest Workflow.**

**CONTEXT:**
- **Sources:** Refer to `/home/ubuntu/my_manus_knowledge/library/research_sources.md` for a list of URLs to monitor.
- **Keywords:** Refer to `/home/ubuntu/my_manus_knowledge/library/monitored_keywords.md` for relevant tags.

**INSTRUCTIONS:**
1.  Iterate through each URL in `research_sources.md`.
2.  For each URL, identify and extract new articles (published within the last 24 hours or since the last run).
3.  For each new article:
    a.  Save raw content to `/home/ubuntu/my_manus_knowledge/inbox/`.
    b.  Summarize the article.
    c.  Auto-tag using `monitored_keywords.md` and content analysis.
    d.  Identify and suggest cross-links to existing documents in `/home/ubuntu/my_manus_knowledge/archive/`.
    e.  Move to `/home/ubuntu/my_manus_knowledge/archive/` and update `archive/index.md`.
4.  Generate a summary report of all newly ingested articles, including their titles, summaries, tags, and cross-links.
5.  Notify the user with the summary report.
```

**New Directories/Files Needed:**

*   `/home/ubuntu/my_manus_knowledge/library/research_sources.md`: A Markdown file listing URLs of trusted research sources, one URL per line.
*   `/home/ubuntu/my_manus_knowledge/logs/ingestion_log_[YYYY-MM-DD].md`: A log file to record details of each ingestion run (e.g., articles found, processed, errors).

**Metrics for Success:**

*   **Automation Rate:** Process 90% of new articles from `research_sources.md` without manual intervention.
*   **Tagging Accuracy:** 85% of auto-assigned tags are relevant and accurate (to be manually reviewed initially).
*   **Cross-Linking Relevance:** 70% of suggested cross-links are contextually meaningful.
*   **Latency Reduction:** Average time from article publication to ingestion and indexing reduced by 75% compared to manual process.
*   **User Satisfaction:** User reports increased efficiency and better contextual awareness from the system.

This blueprint outlines a significant step towards a more autonomous and intelligent knowledge management system. Your approval will initiate the implementation of this new workflow.
